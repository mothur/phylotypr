Description: 
    Package for classification based analysis of DNA sequences. This package 
    primarily implements Naive Bayesian Classifier from the Ribosomal Database
    Project. This approach has traditionally been used to classify 16S rRNA gene
    sequences to bacterial taxonomic outlines; however, it can be used for any
    type of gene sequence. The method was originally described by Wang, Garrity, Tiedje, and
    Cole in Applied and Environmental Microbiology 73(16):5261-7
    <doi:10.1128/AEM.00062-07>. The package also provides functions to read in
    FASTA-formatted sequence data.
